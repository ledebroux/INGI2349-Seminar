\subsection{Verifying forwarding plane connectivity}
This article presents a way to detect and locate a single arbitrary node or link failure.
In order to do so, the controller will install multiple sets of static routing rules in the switches.

The first set is used to detect whether there is a failure or not in the network.
The main idea is to create an Euler cycle in the network ()if the network does not allow one, the trick is to duplicate all link and build a directed graph, which will force the existence of such a cycle). The controller will then attach itself to a node in the network and send a control message. This message will be then propagated around the cycle and will loop back to the controller if all links and node are operating properly.

The second set of forwarding rules is used to locate the failure in the network. The controller will send a second control message which should loop back to the control after reaching a given node. The controller will keep repeating this operation, allowing it to perform a binary search over the nodes until it locates the link or node that has failed.

\textbf{Limitations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item This only works in case of a single link or node failure. (As the same node can be in different places fo the cycle thus breaking it multiple times)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Enabling fast failure recovery in OpenFlow Networks}
The topic of this article is to present a way of doing fast failure recovery in openflow networks.
The idea is to make sure that upon the acknowledgment of a failure by the controller, there is an efficient way to quickly inform the openflow switches.

To do so, the article presents an algorithm on how to recover from a failure fast enough and on the whole network.
For the method to work, there are several requierments from the controller. These are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The controller must know about the failure
	\item The controller must remember the paths it established
	\item The controller must be able to compute a new path
	\item The controller knows all the current flows in the network
\end{itemize}
The algorithm states that upon a link failure, a new path is computed for every path that goes through this link.
Then, in each switch of the network that has an entry related to the old broken path, the entry is delete and new ones are pushed to establish the new path.

The results in the article are restoration times of about 12ms. In large networks, the goal is to propose restoration times that are below 50ms.
